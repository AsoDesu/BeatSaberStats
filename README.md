# Beat Saber Stats

A collection of scripts to generate stats for Beat Saber levels!

### This doesn't download any maps from BeatSaver, you have to collect them yourself

## Usage
### compile.js
Generates a full list of Ranked Maps from the [Ranked Maps Playlists](https://github.com/aplulu/bs-ranked-playlist)
1. Create 2 folders called `out` and `data`
2. In the `data` folder, place the ranked playlists in there
3. Run `node compile.js`, and you'll see in the `out` folder a file called `ranked.txt` appear! This file contains all the hashes for every Ranked Map.
